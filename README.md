## Objective
This repo stores a jupyter notebook with functions useful for my day to day data analysis, it holds back of the envelope calculations for different projects like fitting, filtering, data alignment through resampling but mainly functions to convert to and from CSVs.
It also stores a different jupyter notebook that is more cattered towards computing noise sourcess in a 2 stages signal chain.
